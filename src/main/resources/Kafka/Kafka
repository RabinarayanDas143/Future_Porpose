 1. What is Kafka
 =======================================================
 -> Apache Kafka is a publish-subscribe based messaging system. It is fast, scalable and distributed by design.
 -> It was initially thought of as a message queue and open-source by Linkedin in 2011.
 -> Publish-subcribe to stream of records like message queue.
 -> It provide storage system, so that message can be stored asynchronously.
 -> Traditional messaging models are queue and publish-subscribe. In a queue each record goes to one consumer.
    but in publish-subscribe one message goes to multiple consumer.
    
 Props of Kafka
 =====================================================
 -> Loose coupling : Each service does not know each other regarding data update matters.
 -> Durability : Its guarantees that message will be delivered even if the consumer service is down.
                 When the consumer get up again, all message will be delivered.
 -> Scalability : Since the messages get stored in bucket, there is no need for response.
                  We create async communication between all services.
 -> Flexibility : Sender does not know who is consume the message, meaning you can add new consumer with less work.
 
 Cons of Kafka
 ====================================================
  -> The developer need to have deep knowledge about message flow .
  -> Its hard to debug.
  
 Difference between Active MQ Vs Rabbit MQ Vs Kafka Communication.
 ==============================================================================================================
          Active MQ(AM)/ Rabbit MQ(RM)                                                   Kafka
  -----------------------------------------                            ------------------------------------------------
  -> AM developed by LogicBlaze, as an open source message broker.  -> Initially developed by Linkedin, Later in 2011 Kafka was open source. developed via Apache Software.
     Later donated to Apache Software foundation.
     
  -> Written in AM - Java                                           -> Written in java and Scala
                RM - Erlang
  -> PTP messaging system.                                          -> Publish-subscribe messaging system.
  -> It deal with a small amount of data.                           -> It deal with huge amount of data
  -> There is one sender and one consumer of data, if multiple      -> There is one publisher and multiple consumer at a time.
     consumer come then it connect in queue.
  -> Data is not stored in memory box.                              -> Data is stored in one Memory box.
  -> Data consistency is low .                                      -> Data consistency is high.
  -> Responsibilty of producer to ensure delivery of messages.      -> Responsibilty of consumer to consume message.
  -> It handel 4k to 10k message per second.                        -> It handle 1 million message per second.
  -> Support both Sync and Async communication.                                   -> Support only Async communication.
  
 Step to Configure Kafka
 ==============================================
 -> You need to install Zookeeper and Kafka. 
 -> To configure Kafka, we install Java, download Kafka binaries, start Zookeeper, then start the Kafka broker.
    After that, we create topics and test message production and consumption using Kafka CLI tools
    
 Topic 
 ===========================================================
 -> Topic is a bucket of message where services may place or read the messages.
 -> Atopic is similar laike a folder and the messages are similar like files in that folder.
 -> Topics are multiple producer and multiple subscriber.
 -> Message can be read many time as needed. because it store messages in a memory box.
 -> A topic can also have multiple partition. this allows multiple consumer read that message parallel.
 -> Topics are partitioned for scalability and replicated for fault tolerance.
 
 What is a Kafka Cluster?
 =====================================================
 -> A Kafka cluster is a group of Kafka brokers (servers) working together to store, manage, and distribute data (messages).
 
 Producer
 =======================================
 -> A producer send/write messages to the topic within the cluster.
 
 Consumer
 =======================================
 -> A consumer is read the messages from the Kafka cluster.
 -> A consumer can read the data in same time from multiple broker.
 
 Broker
 ====================================
 -> A kafka broker is a bridge between producer and consumer. if a producer produce one message to the cluster, it is sent to the 
    kafka server. A kafka broker allows consumer to fetch that message by topic.
 -> All broker are maintained inside Kafka cluster.
 -> To maintain the load balance of the kafka cluster it have multiple kafka broker.
 
 Partitions
 =====================================
 -> The messages is divided in to small subparts/ replicated known as partitions.
 -> Each partitions carries data.
 
 Zookeeper
 ====================================
 -> Kafka broker use Zookeepeer for managing and cordinating purpose.
 -> There are multiple Zookeepeer inside cluster.
 -> A user does not directly interact with zoopeeper, but via broker.
 -> No kafka serveris run without zookeeper server. It is mandatory to run the zookeeper server.
